# DC-06 -- Wiki Restructuring

**Status:** Not yet designed. See [UC-08](../UC-08-refactor-existing-wiki.md).

## Purpose

Owns the interactive restructuring of an existing wiki -- adding missing pages, removing obsolete pages, reorganizing sections, and updating navigation. Discovered as a gap during DC-01 (Wiki Creation) design: if writer agents partially fail, the wiki has content so `/init-wiki` refuses to run, and `/refresh-wiki` is not interactive.

## Use cases
